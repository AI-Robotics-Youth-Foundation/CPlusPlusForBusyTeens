# C++ Fundamentals for the Busy Teens

Welcome to the C++ Fundamentals course for teens! This repository contains everything you need to run an engaging, hands-on C++ primer, including interactive slides and code exercises.

## 🚀 What's in this Repo?

- **Course Slides:** Modern, interactive presentation in `slides.html` (view in your browser)
- **Hands-on Lessons & Exercises:** Step-by-step C++ tutorials and coding practice
- **Project Structure & Resources:** Organized for easy navigation and extension

## 📖 How to Use

1. **View the Course Slides:**
   - Open `slides.html` in your web browser for the full course overview and roadmap.
2. **Explore Lessons & Code:**
   - Lessons and exercises are in the `lessons/` and `exercises/` folders.
3. **No Extra Setup Needed:**
   - All required libraries (like reveal.js for slides) are included in `libs/`—no npm or external downloads required.

## 📁 Folder Structure & Conventions

- `slides.html` — Main course presentation (uses reveal.js from `libs/`)
- `lessons/` — Step-by-step C++ tutorials and slides
- `exercises/` — Hands-on coding practice
- `projects/` — Major build challenges
- `simulations/` — Interactive robot/game simulators
- `resources/` — Reference materials & cheat sheets
- `challenges/` — Bonus advanced problems
- `tools/` — Helper utilities and templates
- `libs/` — All third-party libraries (e.g., `libs/revealjs`)

**Convention:**

- All external libraries go in `libs/`, named by library (e.g., `libs/revealjs`).
- Keep the project root clean—put new dependencies in `libs/`.

## 🤝 Contributing & Extending

- Want to add a new lesson, exercise, or library? Just follow the folder conventions above.
- For new dependencies, add them to `libs/` and update references as needed.
- PRs and suggestions are welcome!
