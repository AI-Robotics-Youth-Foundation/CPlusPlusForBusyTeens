## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Speaker View Won't Open

1. **Check browser popups**: Enable popups for your site
2. **Try different browser**: Chrome/Firefox work best
3. **Manual method**: Open second browser window, add `?print-pdf#/speaker-notes` to URL

### Can't See Teaching Scripts

1. **Verify file**: Make sure you're using `slides-with-scripts.html`
2. **Check slides**: Look for `<aside class="notes">` sections
3. **Refresh**: Try reloading both windows

### Windows Not Syncing

1. **Same browser**: Use same browser for both windows
2. **Keyboard navigation**: Use arrow keys, not mouse clicks
3. **Refresh both**: Close speaker view, press `S` again

## 📱 Alternative Setups

### Option A: Tablet as Teleprompter

1. Open teaching script files on tablet/phone
2. Position near your laptop screen
3. Navigate manually or use auto-scroll app
4. Students see presentation, you see scripts on device

### Option B: Printed Backup

1. Print key slide scripts (Introduction, first few lessons)
2. Keep as backup during presentation
3. Highlight timing cues and transitions
4. Use if technical issues arise

### Option C: Second Laptop

1. Open slides on laptop 1 (for projection)
2. Open script files on laptop 2 (for reference)
3. Navigate both manually
4. Good for very large presentations

## 🎭 Sample Teaching Flow

Here's how it looks in practice:

### Slide 1: Title Slide

- Current slide: Title slide with course name
- Script: "Good morning everyone! Who here uses TikTok..."
- Timer: 00:00 (just started)
- Next: Preview of "What is a Program?" slide

**Students see:**

- Current slide: "What is a Program?" with bullet points
- Script: "Think about this - when you're playing a game..."
- Timer: 01:30 (elapsed time)
- Next: Preview of "What is Programming?" slide

**Your actions:**
