# 🖥️ Perfect Dual-Screen Setup Guide

## 🎯 **Goal: Two Synchronized Windows**

You want:

- **Window 1**: Clean slides (students/projector see this)
- **Window 2**: Speaker view with scripts (only you see this)
- **Both windows**: Stay synchronized when you navigate

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Setup**

### Step 1: Open Main Presentation

1. Open `slides-with-scripts.html` in your browser
2. This is your **main presentation window**
3. Position this on your **projector/student screen**

### Step 2: Launch Speaker View

1. In the main window, press `S` key
2. A new window should popup with speaker view
3. If blocked, manually open new window with URL: `slides-with-scripts.html?speaker-view=true`

### Step 3: Position Windows

1. **Main window**: Move to projector/external monitor
2. **Speaker window**: Keep on your laptop screen
3. Make both windows fullscreen if desired

### Step 4: Test Synchronization

1. Navigate using arrow keys in **either window**
2. Both windows should change slides together
3. Speaker view shows scripts, main view shows clean slides

## ✅ **What Each Screen Shows**

### 🎓 **Student/Projector Screen** (Main Window)

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        What is a Program?           │
│                                     │
│  • A set of instructions            │
│  • Like a recipe: step-by-step      │

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: Only one window opens

- **Solution**: Press `S` again, or manually open second browser window
- **URL for speaker view**: Add `?speaker-view=true` to your slides URL

### Issue: Windows not syncing

- **Solution**: Navigate using **keyboard arrows**, not mouse clicks
- **Check**: Both windows should be from the same browser session

### Issue: Can't position windows properly

- **Solution**:
  1. Use window dragging to move between monitors
  2. Try `Cmd+Tab` (Mac) or `Alt+Tab` (Windows) to switch between windows
  3. Make main window fullscreen on projector

## 🎮 **Navigation Tips**

### During Presentation

- **Use arrow keys** to navigate (syncs both windows)
- **Speaker view** shows your script with timing
- **Main view** shows clean slides to students
- **Timer** helps you pace your delivery

### Best Practices

- Practice with dual windows before class
- Have backup: print key scripts
- Test projector setup beforehand
- Keep speaker window out of student view

## ⚡ **Quick Test Right Now**

1. **Refresh** your current speaker view window
2. **Open new tab** with just `slides-with-scripts.html` (no ?speaker-view=true)
3. **Position windows** side by side temporarily
4. **Press arrow keys** in either window
5. **Verify** both windows change slides together

Once working, move windows to proper screens!

## 🎯 **Success Checklist**

- [ ] Main window shows clean slides
- [ ] Speaker window shows scripts + timer
- [ ] Arrow key navigation works in both
- [ ] Windows stay synchronized
- [ ] Can position on different monitors
- [ ] Scripts appear for slides 1-3

**Perfect setup = Confident teaching!** 🚀
