# C++ Course for Teenagers - Project Overview

## Project Purpose
This is a **C++ fundamentals course** designed specifically for teenagers (middle to high schoolers) as preparation for VEX V5 robotics programming using the PROS library. The course focuses on pure C++ instruction with engaging Roblox and robotics analogies.

## Target Audience & Tone
- **Age Group**: Middle to high school students (13-18 years old)
- **Tone**: Teen-friendly, modern, engaging with emoji usage
- **Approach**: Hands-on learning with immediate practical application
- **Context**: Uses Roblox analogies and robotics examples for relatability

## Course Structure
- **Duration**: 8-10 hours total
- **Week 1**: Variables & I/O
- **Week 2**: Control Flow  
- **Week 3**: Objects & Arrays
- **Week 4**: Advanced C++ (Memory/Pointers)
- **Projects**: 4 hands-on projects
- **Exercises**: 20 coding exercises throughout

## Key Design Principles
1. **Pure C++ Focus**: Teach C++ concepts directly, not through comparisons
2. **Engaging Stories**: Use Roblox/robotics as context, not code examples
3. **Practical Application**: Every lesson connects to real-world robotics
4. **Modern Presentation**: Professional but teen-friendly visual design
5. **Self-Contained**: All dependencies included locally

## Main Entry Points
- **Course Presentation**: [slides.html](mdc:slides.html) - reveal.js presentation for course introduction
- **Course Overview**: [README.md](mdc:README.md) - teen-friendly overview with Roblox analogies
- **Build Exclusions**: [.gitignore](mdc:.gitignore) - comprehensive exclusions for C++ projects
