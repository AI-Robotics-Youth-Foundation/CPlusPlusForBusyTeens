# Slide 2: What is a Program? - Teaching Script

## 📱 Slide Content

**Title:** What is a Program?

- A set of instructions for a computer
- Like a recipe: step-by-step directions
- Or a game script: "If you press jump, the character jumps!"
- Or a robot mission: "Move forward, turn, pick up object"

## 🎤 Teacher Script (2 minutes)

### Main Explanation (1 minute)

**"Think about this - when you're playing a game and you press the space bar to jump, how does the computer know what to do?"**

_[Pause for responses]_

**"Exactly! Someone wrote instructions telling the computer: 'When the player presses space, make the character go up 50 pixels, then fall back down.' That's a program - just a list of instructions!"**

**"It's like writing a recipe. If you want to make pancakes, you write: 'Step 1: Mix flour and milk. Step 2: Heat the pan. Step 3: Pour batter.' Programming is the same thing, but instead of making pancakes, you're telling a computer what to do."**

### Interactive Examples (1 minute)

**"Let's try this - imagine you're programming a robot. What instructions would you give it to get a snack from the kitchen?"**

_[Take 2-3 student responses, like "go to kitchen," "open fridge," "grab snack"]_

\*\*"Perfect! You just wrote a program! In real programming, it might look like:

- `moveToRoom("kitchen")`
- `openAppliance("refrigerator")`
- `pickUpItem("apple")`"\*\*

**"The cool thing is, these instructions work the same way whether you're programming a game character, a robot vacuum, or even the app on your phone!"**

## 🎯 Key Message

Programming is just writing step-by-step instructions - like recipes for computers.

## 🚦 Transition

**"So if programming is writing instructions, what exactly IS programming?"**

## 📝 Teacher Notes

- Use hand gestures to show "step by step"
- Make the robot example physical - act it out!
- If students give vague answers like "get food," help them be more specific
- Emphasize that programming isn't mysterious - it's logical thinking they already do
