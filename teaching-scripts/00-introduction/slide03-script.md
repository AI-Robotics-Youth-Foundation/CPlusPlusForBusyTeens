# Slide 3: What is Programming? - Teaching Script

## üì± Slide Content

**Title:** What is Programming?

- Writing instructions for computers to follow
- Turning ideas into actions on a screen or in the real world
- Anyone can learn it‚Äîno magic required!

## üé§ Teacher Script (2 minutes)

### Building on Previous Concept (45 seconds)

**"So we know a program is a set of instructions, like a recipe. But what exactly IS programming?"**

**"Programming is the act of writing those instructions! It's like being a director of a movie - you tell the actors (the computer) exactly what to do, when to do it, and how to do it."**

**"Here's the coolest part - programming lets you take an idea in your head and make it real on a computer screen, or even in the physical world with robots!"**

### Real-World Connection (45 seconds)

**"Think about your favorite app - maybe Instagram or Snapchat. Someone had the idea: 'What if people could share photos with fun filters?' Then they used programming to turn that idea into the app you use every day!"**

**"Or think about those Boston Dynamics robots that can do backflips. Someone programmed every single movement - 'lift leg 30 degrees, shift weight, rotate torso...' Programming brought that robot to life!"**

### Encouragement & Accessibility (30 seconds)

**"Now, I want to make something super clear - programming isn't some mysterious superpower that only 'computer geniuses' can learn. It's a skill, just like learning to drive or cook or play an instrument."**

**"Some of you might think 'I'm not a math person' or 'I'm not technical.' But programming is really about logical thinking and problem-solving - skills you already use every day!"**

## üéØ Key Message

Programming is the bridge between imagination and reality in the digital world.

## üö¶ Transition

**"So if programming is writing instructions, what makes C++ special compared to other programming languages?"**

## üìù Teacher Notes

- Emphasize creativity and problem-solving over technical complexity
- Use concrete examples from apps/technology students actually use
- Address potential self-doubt early - many students think programming is "not for them"
- Keep energy high and visual - use hand gestures to show "ideas becoming real"

## ü§î Anticipated Student Questions

- **Q:** "Do I need to be good at math to program?"
- **A:** "Not really! Programming is more about logical thinking than complex math. If you can follow a recipe or give directions to a friend, you can learn programming!"

- **Q:** "How long does it take to learn programming?"
- **A:** "You'll write your first working program today! Learning never really stops though - even professional programmers learn new things every day."

## üîß Technical Requirements

- None for this slide
- Keep focus on concepts, not technical details yet
