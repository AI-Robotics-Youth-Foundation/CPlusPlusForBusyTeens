# Slide 5: Course Roadmap - Teaching Script

## üì± Slide Content

**Title:** Course Roadmap

- **Setup & Basics:** First programs, variables, I/O, operators
- **Control Flow:** Make decisions, repeat actions
- **Arrays & Strings:** Working with collections of data
- **Functions:** Organizing code, reusable building blocks
- **Structs & Objects:** Grouping related information
- **Standard Library:** Built-in tools for real-world programming
- **Classes & OOP:** Object-oriented design and inheritance
- **Hands-On Project:** Robot gear system engineering challenge

## üé§ Teacher Script (2 minutes)

### Overview Introduction (30 seconds)

**"Alright, let's talk about our journey! This isn't just a random collection of programming concepts - we're building real skills step by step, like levels in a video game!"**

**"Each lesson builds on the last one, so by the end, you'll be creating programs that solve actual engineering problems!"**

### Breaking Down the Journey (1 minute 15 seconds)

**"Let's walk through what we're going to master:"**

**"First, Setup & Basics - we'll get your computer ready and write your first real program. You'll learn how to store information and do calculations."**

**"Then Control Flow - this is where your programs get smart! You'll teach them to make decisions and repeat actions, just like game logic."**

**"Arrays & Strings - imagine managing a whole team of players in Roblox. You'll learn to handle lots of data at once."**

**"Functions - these are like creating your own custom commands. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you'll build reusable pieces."**

**"Structs & Objects - this is where we organize complex information, like creating a player profile with name, level, health, and inventory all in one place."**

**"Standard Library - C++ comes with amazing built-in tools, like having cheat codes for programming! We'll learn to use these professional-grade features."**

**"Classes & OOP - the advanced stuff! You'll create your own types of objects and build sophisticated programs."**

### The Big Project (15 seconds)

**"And throughout everything, we're building toward our final challenge - a robot gear system calculator that real engineers use! You'll analyze gear ratios, calculate speeds, and optimize robotic systems!"**

## üéØ Key Message

This course builds programming skills progressively, culminating in real engineering applications.

## üö¶ Transition

**"This sounds like a lot, but trust me - we're going to take it one step at a time. Ready to jump in and start coding?"**

## üìù Teacher Notes

- Use gaming analogies (levels, skills, building up)
- Emphasize the practical, real-world nature of what they'll learn
- Connect each topic to things students can relate to
- Build excitement for the final project
- Reassure students about the progressive difficulty

## ü§î Anticipated Student Questions

- **Q:** "How long will each lesson take?"
- **A:** "We'll spend about a week on each major topic, with lots of hands-on practice. Don't worry about memorizing everything - focus on understanding and practicing!"

- **Q:** "What if I fall behind?"
- **A:** "That's totally normal! We'll have lots of review and practice time. Plus, helping each other is encouraged - real programmers collaborate all the time!"

## üîß Technical Requirements

- None for this overview slide
- Have the final project examples ready to show if students are curious
