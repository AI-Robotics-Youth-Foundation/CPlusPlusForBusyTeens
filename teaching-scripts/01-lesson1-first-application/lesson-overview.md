## 🎪 Engagement Hooks

- **Primary hook:** "You're about to join the millions of programmers worldwide!"
- **Coding excitement:** First program that actually runs and does something
- **Real-world connection:** Same tools used by professional game developers
- **Achievement unlocked:** From zero to working programmer in one lesson

## 📝 Key Concepts Covered

- Development environment setup
- Basic C++ program structure
- Compilation and execution process
- Standard namespace usage
- Console input and output
- Arithmetic operators
- Function creation and usage
- Engineering applications (gear ratios)

## 🚀 Hands-On Activities

- Install and test C++ compiler
- Write and run "Hello, World!" program
- Create interactive programs using cin/cout
- Build arithmetic calculator for gear ratios
- Solve real engineering problems with code

## 📋 Assessment Opportunities

- **Formative:** Check that everyone can compile and run basic programs
- **Hands-on:** Students demonstrate working "Hello, World!" program
- **Problem-solving:** Complete gear ratio calculator challenge
- **Peer help:** Students assist others with technical setup

## 🔧 Technical Setup Required

- C++ compiler installed (clang++ or g++)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)
- Terminal/command prompt access
- Test program template ready for distribution
- Backup computers for students with technical issues

## 📚 Additional Resources

- [VS Code C++ Setup Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp)
- [C++ Compiler Installation Help](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/)
- Copy-paste code examples for struggling students
- Alternative online compilers (replit.com) as backup

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

- **Compilation errors:** Usually missing semicolons or brackets
- **Path issues:** Compiler not found in system PATH
- **Case sensitivity:** C++ is case-sensitive unlike some other languages
- **Quotation marks:** Smart quotes from phones don't work in code

## 💡 Extension Activities

- Modify Hello World with personal messages
- Create calculator for different types of calculations
- Research what other programs are built with C++
- Explore different text editors and development environments
