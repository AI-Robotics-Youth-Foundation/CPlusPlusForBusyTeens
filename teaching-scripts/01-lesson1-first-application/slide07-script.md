# Slide 7: Create Your First C++ Application - Teaching Script

## 📱 Slide Content

**Title:** 🚀 Create Your First C++ Application  
**Subtitle:** 🛠️ Get Set Up and Run Your First Program

## 🎤 Teacher Script (2 minutes)

### Energy & Excitement (30 seconds)

**"Alright, this is where the real fun begins! We've talked about what programming is - now we're actually going to DO it!"**

**"In the next few slides, you're going to write a program that actually runs on your computer. Not a simulation, not a game - a real program that YOU created!"**

### Reality Check & Encouragement (45 seconds)

**"Now, I'm going to be honest with you - the first time you write code, it might feel a little weird. It's like learning a new language, because that's exactly what you're doing!"**

**"Some of you might think 'I'm not a computer person' or 'this looks too complicated.' But here's the thing - by the end of this lesson, every single one of you will have a working program. I guarantee it!"**

**"We're going to start super simple. Our first program is going to print 'Hello, world!' to the screen. Sounds boring? Maybe. But this is the exact same first program that every professional programmer in the world has written, including the people who made Fortnite, Instagram, and Tesla's self-driving cars!"**

### Set Expectations (45 seconds)

**"Here's what we're going to do step by step:**

1. **Set up our tools** - like getting your art supplies ready before painting
2. **Write our first program** - just a few lines of code
3. **Run it and see it work** - the magic moment when YOUR code comes to life!"

**"Don't worry about understanding every detail right now. Think of this like learning to drive - first you just need to know 'gas pedal makes car go.' The details come later!"**

## 🎯 Key Message

Today you become a real programmer by creating something that actually works.

## 🚦 Transition

**"So let's get our tools ready! First thing we need is..."**

## 📝 Teacher Notes

- This is the transition from theory to practice - build excitement!
- Address anxiety directly - many students feel intimidated
- Use the "Hello, world!" tradition to connect them to programmer culture
- Keep energy high but also realistic about the learning curve
- Emphasize the accomplishment they're about to achieve
