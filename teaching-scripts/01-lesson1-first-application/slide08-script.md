# Slide 8: What You Need - Teaching Script

## üì± Slide Content

**Title:** What You Need

- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., clang++ or g++)
- **Text Editor or IDE** (e.g., VS Code, Xcode, Sublime Text)
- A terminal (the **Terminal** app on Mac)

## üé§ Teacher Script (3 minutes)

### Introduction (30 seconds)

**"Alright, before we can start programming, we need to set up our tools! Think of this like getting your gaming setup ready - you need the right equipment to play."**

**"Don't worry if this sounds technical - we're going to walk through everything step by step, and I'll help anyone who gets stuck!"**

### Breaking Down the Requirements (2 minutes)

**"We need three main things:"**

**"First, a C++ Compiler. This is like a translator that converts your human-readable code into something the computer can actually run. It's like having Google Translate, but for computers!"**

_[Point to the slide]_

**"The two most common ones are called 'clang++' and 'g++'. Don't worry about the difference - they both do the same job. We'll get one of these installed in just a minute."**

**"Second, we need a Text Editor or IDE. IDE stands for 'Integrated Development Environment' - fancy name for a really good text editor made specifically for programming."**

**"Think of it like the difference between writing a paper in Notepad versus Microsoft Word. You CAN write code in any text editor, but these special ones have features that make programming much easier - they highlight your code in colors, catch mistakes, and help you organize everything."**

**"And third, we need access to the Terminal. This is like the 'behind the scenes' control panel for your computer. It looks a bit retro and scary at first, but it's actually really powerful!"**

### Encouragement (30 seconds)

**"I know this might seem like a lot of setup, but here's the cool part - once we get this done today, you'll have the same exact tools that professional programmers at Google, Apple, and game studios use every day!"**

**"Plus, all of this software is free! You don't need to buy anything expensive to start programming."**

## üéØ Key Message

Professional programming tools are free and accessible - we're setting up a real development environment.

## üö¶ Transition

**"Let's start with getting the compiler installed. For Mac users, this is actually pretty easy..."**

## üìù Teacher Notes

- Emphasize that this is professional-grade setup, not toy software
- Address any anxiety about technical setup
- Prepare for different operating systems if needed
- Have backup plan for students with restricted computer access
- Use analogies students can relate to (gaming setup, MS Word vs Notepad)

## ü§î Anticipated Student Questions

- **Q:** "Do I need to buy anything?"
- **A:** "Nope! Everything we're using is completely free. One of the great things about programming is that the best tools are usually free!"

- **Q:** "What if I mess up my computer?"
- **A:** "You won't! We're just installing software, like installing any other app. Nothing we do can hurt your computer."

- **Q:** "Can I use my phone or tablet?"
- **A:** "While there are some mobile coding apps, we really need a full computer for this course. The tools are designed for keyboards and larger screens."

## üîß Technical Requirements

- Know which operating systems students are using
- Have installation instructions ready for different platforms
- Test the installation process on classroom computers beforehand
- Have backup online compiler ready (like replit.com) for problematic setups
