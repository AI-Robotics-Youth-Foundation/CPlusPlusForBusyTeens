### File Naming Convention

Each lesson folder contains:

- `slideXX-script.md` - Teaching script for slide XX
- `lesson-overview.md` - Lesson objectives and timing
- `troubleshooting.md` - Common student questions and issues

## 🎯 Teaching Philosophy

### Age-Appropriate Language (Grades 6-9)

- Use gaming and social media analogies
- Relate concepts to Roblox, robots, and everyday technology
- Keep explanations concrete with visual examples
- Encourage experimentation and "what if" thinking

### Engagement Strategies

- **Hook:** Start each lesson with a relatable problem
- **Demo:** Show working code before explaining theory
- **Practice:** Hands-on coding every 10-15 minutes
- **Connect:** Link to students' interests (games, social media, robotics)

### Timing Guidelines

- **Introduction:** 5 slides, 10 minutes
- **Lesson 1:** 15 slides, 45 minutes
- **Lesson 2:** 12 slides, 40 minutes
- **Lesson 3:** 8 slides, 30 minutes
- **Lesson 4:** 11 slides, 45 minutes
- **Project 1:** 8 slides, 60 minutes (hands-on)
- **Lesson 5:** 10 slides, 40 minutes
- **Lesson 6:** 15 slides, 50 minutes
- **Lesson 7:** 8 slides, 35 minutes

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

### Setup Requirements

- VS Code installed on all student computers
- C++ compiler (clang++ or g++)
- Internet access for initial setup
- Prepared code examples ready to copy/paste

### Common Challenges

- Students typing code exactly as shown
- Case sensitivity issues
- Semicolon and bracket errors
- Compilation vs. runtime errors

### Assessment Ideas

- Code challenges after each lesson
- Peer programming sessions
- Show-and-tell coding presentations
- Real-world application discussions
