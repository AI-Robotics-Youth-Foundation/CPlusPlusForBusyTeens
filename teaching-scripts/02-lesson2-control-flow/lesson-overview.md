# Lesson 2: Control Flow - Overview

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Use if statements to make decisions in their programs
- Apply comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) correctly
- Create complex decision trees using if/else if/else chains
- Implement while and for loops for repetitive tasks
- Use the break statement to exit loops early
- Solve real-world problems using control flow structures

## ⏰ Timing: 40 minutes total

- Slide 23 (Control Flow Intro): 2 minutes
- Slide 24 (If Statements): 4 minutes
- Slide 25 (Comparison Operators): 3 minutes
- Slide 26 (Else and Else If): 5 minutes
- Slide 27 (Challenge 1 - Roblox Ranker): 8 minutes
- Slide 28 (Loops Introduction): 4 minutes
- Slide 29 (Challenge 2 - Counting Game): 5 minutes
- Slide 30 (Challenge 3 - Guessing Game): 6 minutes
- Slide 31 (Break Statement): 3 minutes

## 🎪 Engagement Hooks

- **Primary hook:** "How do games know when you win or lose?"
- **Interactive elements:** Live coding of game logic examples
- **Real-world connection:** Game mechanics students recognize (health systems, scoring)
- **Challenge progression:** From simple decisions to complete game logic

## 📝 Key Concepts Covered

- Boolean logic and decision making
- Comparison and logical operators
- Conditional statements (if/else if/else)
- Loop structures (while and for loops)
- Loop control with break statements
- Practical problem-solving with control flow

## 🚀 Hands-On Activities

- Build age categorization program
- Create Roblox-style ranking system
- Program counting and countdown sequences
- Develop number guessing game
- Debug common control flow issues

## 📋 Assessment Opportunities

- **Live coding:** Students modify existing if/else logic
- **Problem solving:** Complete the three coding challenges
- **Peer review:** Students explain their logic to classmates
- **Debugging:** Fix intentionally broken control flow examples

## 🔧 Technical Setup Required

- Working C++ environment from Lesson 1
- Example programs with deliberate errors for debugging practice
- Template code for challenges ready to distribute
- Random number generation examples prepared

## 📚 Additional Resources

- [C++ Control Flow Reference](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/control/)
- Flowchart examples for visual learners
- Gaming logic examples (health systems, scoring mechanisms)
- Alternative challenge problems for advanced students

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

- **Assignment vs comparison:** Using = instead of == in conditions
- **Infinite loops:** Forgetting to update loop variables
- **Logic errors:** Complex conditional statements that don't work as expected
- **Bracket matching:** Missing or extra braces in if/else blocks

## 💡 Extension Activities

- Create more complex game scenarios
- Build calculator with multiple operations
- Design decision trees for real-world problems
- Research game mechanics that use similar logic
